&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication is a key part of working together in any community, and Mariveles Senior High School – Sitio Mabuhay is no exception. Students, teachers, and staff all need to share ideas, give feedback, and solve problems together to make the school run smoothly. This study looks at how people on campus communicate and collaborate, focusing on how information is shared and teamwork is supported. By understanding how communication happens at Mariveles Senior High School, we can identify strategies and tools that make working together easier and more effective. Improving communication on campus not only helps accomplish tasks but also creates a friendlier and more supportive environment for learning and growth.
